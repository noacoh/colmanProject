# Project Goals - Existing System Enhancement
UI/UX enhancement - Create a more intuitive and appealing design for the user.

# Functionality -
Better file management - enabling the user to retrieve previous files submitted by him.
The system will save the files for a limited period of time, where during that time, the files will be available for the user. After the time period has expired, the user will receive an email message informing him of removal the files from the DB.

Cheating Detection - The system will try and detect cheating by students, and inform the professor of it.
